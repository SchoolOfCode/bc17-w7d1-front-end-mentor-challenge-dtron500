# Front End Mentor Challenge

This is my attempt at the Challenge

## What went well
I enjoyed the struggle of this project, as I have not used CSS much in the last few weeks it was difficult to get my head around. 

I asked the right questions and found suitable resources to aid me in this task. 
I also managed to complete the task to the best of my ability despite not being at my 100%
## Could do better 

I struggled with a lot of the syntax with this task, especially with the CSS. 
I also heavily relied on help from the AI to get this project done, which I understand can be a long term hindrance.

In the future I will plan better and try to only use AI as a last resort.
